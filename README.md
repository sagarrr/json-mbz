The primary objective is to make LDSHE compatible with Moodle.
The script is written in node.js

Current installation instructions :

1) Clone the repo
2) npm install in the directory
3) convert the name of the JSON file to "first.json"
4) run node main.js
6) further compress the created .tar to .gz
7) upload the tar.gz file to restore!

Futher work:
